        <p>Around this time California is growing in popularity. The mood is always up, prosperity rules everywhere, and the standard of living is high . I would say that it is the land of plenty for a new generation of movers and shakers who reinvented the way America would live.
        Today I coined the term "Post up" which I am told means to stand around without doing much.</p>
